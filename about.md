# Sabbatical work, 2021-2022


On this site, I'm documenting my work to address gaps in our current infrastructure for studying ancient Greek during a sabbatical in 2021-2022.  I'm attempting to explain not only the code I'm developing, but the scholarly perspective that guides my decisions.  


My intention is to develop complete solutions to the problems I analyze here during the course of the sabbatical.  All pages include the date the site was last modified, so you can see whether work is incomplete or has gone stale.


The code is openly licensed and freely available on github. All examples of code on the web site are executed as part of the build process, and all example output you see was automatically generated, so you can be sure that the examples can be replicated.
