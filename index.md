# Greek in the twenty-first century

On this site, I'm documenting some of my work in progress to address gaps in our current infrastructure for studying ancient Greek.  I'm attempting to explain not only the code I'm developing, but the scholarly perspective that guides my decisions.  


The code is openly licensed and freely availale on github. All examples of code on the web site are executed as part of the build process, and all example output you see was automatically generated, so you can be sure that the examples can be replicated.
