# The Julia libraries

The code in the Julia language that I present on this site is organized in four packages.


- [Orthography](https://hcmid.github.io/Orthography.jl/stable/). Defines an interface for validating codepoint usage and parsing strings into classified tokens.
- [PolytonicGreek](https://neelsmith.github.io/PolytonicGreek.jl/stable/).   
- AtticGreek. Not yet a registered package.
- Kanones. Not yet a registered package.  See the [github repository](https://github.com/neelsmith/Kanones.jl) for a summary of its current state.
