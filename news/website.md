# Not an April fool's announcement

I published [this web site](https://neelsmith.github.io/DigitalGreek/)[^1] today as an initial placeholder for my thoughts about and contributions towards solving what I see as major shortcomings in our current infrastructure for working with digital texts in ancient Greek.  I've included a short "[About](https://neelsmith.github.io/DigitalGreek/about/)" page describing where I think the site is headed.

My plan is to post notes and documentation here as the project develops, and to use Franklin's support for running code to flesh out discussion with worked examples.  All the code is run and tested when the web site is built, so you can play along at home if you want to reproduce any of the code examples.






[^1]: Thanks, github pages, for the free hosting, and [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), for the site builder that supports running and testing Julia code.
