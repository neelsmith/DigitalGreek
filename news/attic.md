# `AtticGreek` registered

Version 0.1.0 of a new `AtticGreek` package is available today from the Julia registry.

This first release is limited, but it does implement the `Orthography` interface.  You can validate and tokenize strings encoded for the alphabet used in Athenian public documents before the alphabetic reform in the archonship of Euclid, in 403 BCE.

Let's examine the Unicode codepoints that `AtticGreek` accepts.

```
using AtticGreek
attic = atticGreek()
cps codepoints(attic)
@show(cps)
```

Differences:

- breathings
- vowels + all iotas adscript
- compound consonants


Mostly follows conventions used in trad. epigraphic pubs. 

h for rough; closer to stone in making smooth silent default (the unmarked category)

No circumflex on eps.omic in Unicode so using ehat ohat


Tokenize edoxsen tei bole

Like PolytonicGreek, supports a quantity marker.

Thus can use AtticGreek in a lexicon for Kanones. 

Example: bole
