# `AtticGreek` package registered

Version 0.1.0 of a new `AtticGreek` package is available today from the Julia registry.

This first release is limited, but it does implement the `OrthographicSystem` interface from the `Orthography` package, so you can use this version to validate and tokenize strings encoded for the alphabet used in Athenian public documents before the reforms of the archonship of Euclid, in 403 BCE.

The highlighted text in this formulaic inscription illustrates the main differences from literary Greek orthography:

- rough breathing is explicitly indicated, but smooth breathing is unmarked
- there are only five vowels: no eta or omega, and all iotas are adscript
- there are no compound consonants zeta, xi or psi
- the "spurious diphthongs" are spelled with a single epsilon or omicron
- there are no accents



Let's examine the Unicode codepoints that `AtticGreek` accepts.


```julia:./code_home/imports
using AtticGreek, Orthography
attic = atticGreek()
cps = codepoints(attic)
@show(cps)
```

\output{./code_home/imports}

`AtticGreek` mostly follows conventions used in traditional epigraphic print publications. Where the glyphs of the Attic alphabet can be easiliy mapped on to codepoints for standard literary Greek characters, those are used.Latin *h* indicates rough breathing; Latin *e* and *o* are used when necessary to add a circumflex (since Unicode does not support circumflex on epsilon or omicron characters).


We can now use our Attic orthography to validate a transcription of the phrase highlighted above.  (We'll use the `Orthography` package's `nfkc` function to normalize our typing to Unicode form `:NFKC`).

```julia:./code_home/imports
using AtticGreek, Orthography
attic = atticGreek()
s = nfkc("έδοχσεν τêι βολêι καὶ τôι δέμοι")
@show(validstring(attic, s))
```
\output{./code_home/imports}

We can also tokenize Attic strings.

```julia:./code_home/imports
using AtticGreek, Orthography
attic = atticGreek()
s = nfkc("hο δêμος")
tokens = Orthography.tokenize(attic, s)
@show(tokens)
```
\output{./code_home/imports}

## Next steps

In version 0.2, I plan to implement the `GreekOrthography` interface to support accentuation, syllabification and sorting.  This will make it possible to implement morphological parsers using the `Kanones` package with an `AtticGreek` orthography.
