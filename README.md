# Digital Greek

This repository hosts the source for the web site at <https://neelsmith.github.io/DigitalGreek/>.


Digital Greek discusses ways to work computationally with the orthographies and morphologies of text corpora in many varieties of ancient Greek.  It includes replicable examples of code.

All examples of code on the web site are executed as part of the build process, and all example output you see was automatically generated.
